## What Is a Replica?

A **Replica** is a lifelike AI-generated video model powered by Tavus’ Phoenix model. It generates realistic replica videos from a script, complete with natural facial movements, lip sync, and expressive speech in over 30 languages.

The **Phoenix model** uses neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to create dynamic 3D facial renderings, bypassing traditional CGI or deepfake methods. With just 2 minutes of training video, a Replica can learn how someone looks, speaks, and moves.

<Tip>
For training video requirements and best practices, see the [Replica Training](/sections/replica/replica-training) article.
