## What Is a Replica?

A **Replica** is a hyper-realistic video model. They can be Personal, Stock, or Non-Human, depending on your needs.

Replicas are generated by **Phoenix**, our fully synthetic 3D-based model. Phoenix generates video replicas, complete with natural facial movements (lip, cheek, nose, and chin) and expressions synchronized with the generated voice. Developed by our team, Phoenix's novel approach bypasses traditional methods and constructs dynamic, three-dimensional facial scenes using neural radiance fields (NeRFs).
