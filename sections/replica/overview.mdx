## What Is a Replica?

A **Replica** is a hyper-realistic digital human generated by Tavus’s Phoenix model.

The **Phoenix model** uses a Gaussian diffusion architecture designed to capture fine facial detail, including micro-expressions and emotional nuance, in real time. With just 2 minutes of training video, it can learn and accurately reproduce a person's appearance, voice, and movement.
