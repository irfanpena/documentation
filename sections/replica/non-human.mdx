To create a **non-human replica**, you do **not** need to submit a consent video.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A valid **Tavus API key**
- A **pre-recorded training video** that follows the guidelines in the [Replica Training](/sections/replica-training) article  
- A **publicly accessible S3 URL** of your video, valid for at least **24 hours**

## Create a Non-human Replica

Use the following request to create the replica:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://tavusapi.com/v2/replicas \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
    "callback_url": "",
    "replica_name": "<your_replica_name>",
    "train_video_url": "<prerecorded_video_s3_url>"
  }'
```
<Note> By default, replicas are trained using the `phoenix-3` model. To use an older version, set `"model_name": "phoenix-2"` in your request body. However, we strongly recommend using the latest `phoenix-3` model for improved quality and performance. </Note>
Once submitted, your replica will begin training in the background. This process typically takes 4â€“6 hours.

## Check Replica Status
You can monitor the training status using this endpoint:
```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url https://tavusapi.com/v2/replicas/{replica_id} \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>'

```
Start Using Your Replica
Once training is complete, you can use your non-human replica for:
