description: Learn how to generate high-quality videos using Replicas.
---

Tavus lets you generate high-quality AI videos using either **Stock** or **Personal Replicas**. Whether you're producing personalized outreach, marketing content, or AI-driven demos, the video generation engine turns your scripts into photorealistic talking-head videos in just minutes.

<Note>
**Note**:
- Video generation may take a few minutes, depending on script length.  
- Token usage is based on video duration.  
- Output can vary slightly even with the same script and Replica.  
- Well-written scripts improve tone, pacing, and realism â€” see the [Scripting Guide](/sections/video-generation/scripting-prompting) for tips.
</Note>

## Input Options
Tavus supports two input types:

- **Text Script**: Provide written text that the Replica will speak using its AI-generated voice.

- **Audio File**: Upload a `.wav` or `.mp3` file to have the Replica use the voice from your recording.

## Output and Distribution

Once generated, videos can be:

* **Streamed or Downloaded**: Generated video is hosted on a shareable URL. If a callback is set, a download link is returned when the video generated.
* **Embedded or Shared**: Use the provided links to distribute your videos across social media, internal tools, or customer platforms.

## Getting Started
You can create a personalized video content using the [Tavus Platform](https://platform.tavus.io/) or by following the steps in the [Video GenerationAPI Quickstart Guide](/sections/video/quickstart).
