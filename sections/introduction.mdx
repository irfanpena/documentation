Tavus uses the **Conversational Video Interface (CVI)** as its **end-to-end pipeline** to bring the human layer to AI. CVI combines a **Persona**, which defines the AI’s behavior through layers like perception, turn-taking, and speech recognition, with a **Replica**, a lifelike digital human that brings the conversation to life visually.
