Tavus uses the <a href="http://localhost:3000/sections/conversational-video-interface/overview-cvi" target="_blank">Conversational Video Interface (CVI)</a> as its end-to-end pipeline to bring the human layer to AI. CVI combines a <a href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/overview" target="_blank">Persona</a>, which defines the AI’s behavior through layers like perception, turn-taking, and speech recognition, with a <a href="/sections/replica/overview" target="_blank">Replica</a>, a lifelike digital human that brings the conversation to life visually.
