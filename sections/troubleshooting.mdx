  <Accordion title="Training Video Size">
    The Tavus platform accepts training videos **up to 750 MB in size**. This limitation is based on our observations of optimal balance between video quality and processing efficiency.

    ### File Size Considerations

    - **Efficiency**: Smaller files upload and process faster, speeding up model training.
    - **Success Rate**: Files under the recommended size are more likely to process smoothly, while larger files (up to 750 MB) may fail.
    - **Quality Preservation**: Reduce file size without compromising resolution, frame rate, or audio, as these are vital for high-quality Phoenix model training.

    ### Tips for Reducing Video File Size

    1. **Compression**: Use video compression tools to reduce file size while maintaining quality.
    <Note>Currently, the **H.264 codec is required** by Tavus to ensure efficient compression.</Note>
    2. **Resolution Adjustment**: Lower the resolution if needed—1080p is typically sufficient for training.
    3. **Trimming**: Cut unnecessary footage to reduce video length and file size.
    4. **Frame Rate**: Reduce frame rate to around 30 fps to cut file size with minimal quality loss.

  <Accordion title="Consent Statement">

    To generate a digital replica using the Phoenix model, the training video must include a **clearly spoken consent statement**. This is required to uphold ethical standards and comply with data protection regulations. Submissions without this statement cannot be processed.

    > "I, [FULL NAME], am currently speaking and give consent to Tavus to create an AI clone of me by using the audio and video samples I provide. I understand that this AI clone can be used to create videos that look and sound like me."

    ### Key Points

    - **Personalization**: Replace "[FULL NAME]" with your actual full name.
    - **Clarity**: The statement must be clearly audible and understandable.
    - **Placement**: This consent should be at the beginning of your training video to ensure correct processing.
    - **Language**: We currently accept consent statements in **any** of our supported languages. You can see the [supported languages here](/sections/replicas/language-support#languages-we-support).

    ### Tips for Successful Consent Recording

    - **Environment**: Record in a quiet setting to ensure the consent statement is clearly heard.
    - **Articulation**: Speak slowly and clearly, articulating each word to prevent any misunderstandings.
    - **Verification**: Review your video before submission to verify that the consent statement is correctly included and easily audible.

    ### Troubleshooting Missing Consent

    If you have submitted a training video without the requisite consent statement, it will not be processed, and your request to create a digital replica will be delayed. To resolve this issue:

    1. **Re-Record Your Video**: Include the consent statement at the beginning of your new training video.
    2. **Submit a New Request**: Upload the revised video and submit a new model training request through the Tavus Developer Portal or via API, as applicable.

  <Accordion title="Script Length">

    While Tavus allows flexibility in video length, it's important to note that videos longer than approximately 5 minutes **may affect quality and viewer perception**. Extended durations can lead to more **frequent gesture repetition** and **reduced naturalness** in the replica’s movements, making the presentation feel less dynamic and fluid.

    ### Troubleshooting and Optimization Strategies

    1. **Splitting Longer Content**: For content that naturally extends beyond the 5-minute mark, consider dividing it into shorter segments.
        - **Enhance Engagement**: Shorter videos are often more engaging, keeping viewers' attention focused.
        - **Maintain Quality**: Reduces the likelihood of encountering issues with repeated gestures or unnatural movements.
    2. **Script Refinement**: Refining your script can significantly impact the video's effectiveness and length.
        - **Conciseness**: Ensure your script is concise, delivering your message without unnecessary filler.
        - **Pacing**: Adjust the pacing of your script to fit within the optimal video length, focusing on key points.
    3. **Using Multiple Replicas**: Incorporating different replicas into longer content pieces can introduce variety and maintain viewer interest.
        - **Variety**: Switch between replicas to present different sections of your content.
        - **Personalization**: Use specific replicas for targeted segments, enhancing relevance and engagement.
    4. **Review and Iteration**: After generating your video, review it thoroughly.
        - **Identify Repetitions**: Look for and note any instances of repeated gestures or unnatural movements.
        - **Iteration**: Use insights from your review to refine the script or consider breaking the content into smaller pieces if necessary.
