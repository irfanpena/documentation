You can **fully customize the appearance of your conversation interface** to match your preference. This includes updating the color theme of Daily's Prebuilt UI, allowing you to define primary and background colors that align with your product’s aesthetic. 

## Custom UI Example

Here's a quick example to customize your conversation interface by passing a custom color into the `theme` when embedding the call.

```js
import DailyIframe from "@daily-co/daily-js";

const callFrame = DailyIframe.createFrame({
  iframeStyle: {
    position: "fixed",
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    border: "0",
  },
  theme: {
    colors: {
      accent: "#2F80ED", // primary button and accent color
      background: "#F8F9FA", // main background color
      baseText: "#1A1A1A", // text color
    },
  },
});

callFrame.join({ url: "https://your-domain.daily.co/your-room-name" });
```

<Frame>
  ![](/images/custom-ui-colors.png)
</Frame>

You can customize more than just color values — see the [Daily theme configuration reference](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/prebuilt/customizing-daily-prebuilt-calls-with-color-themes) for all options.
