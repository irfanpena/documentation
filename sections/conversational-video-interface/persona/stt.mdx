description: Learn how to configure the STT layer when creating a persona in Tavus.
---

The STT Layer in Tavus empowers your persona to transcribe and comprehend spoken input in real time. By default, the STT layer in Tavus leverages `smart_turn_detection`, powered by **Sparrow**, for dynamic and responsive conversation flow with intelligent turn-taking.

## Configuring the STT Layer

Define the STT layer under the `layers.stt` object. Below are the parameters available:

### 1. `stt_engine`

Specifies the speech-to-text engine used for transcription.

Here’s a cleaner and more structured version where the note content is integrated into the bullet list itself:

* **Options**:

  * `tavus-advanced` (default) – Offers high-accuracy multilingual transcription.
  * `tavus-turbo` – Provides faster response times with slightly reduced accuracy.

```json
"layers": {
  "stt": {
    "stt_engine": "tavus-advanced"
  }
}
````

### 2. `participant_pause_sensitivity`

Controls how long the participant can pause before the replica responds. This setting helps you fine-tune the pacing of the conversation.

* **Options**:

  * `high`: The replica replies quickly after short pauses. Good for fast and casual conversations.
  * `medium` **(default)**: Balanced timing. Allows natural pauses without feeling rushed or delayed.
  * `low`: The replica waits a bit longer before replying. Useful for slower or more thoughtful discussions.
  * `verylow`: The replica allows even longer pauses before responding.
  * `superlow`: The replica has the longest response delay, making it suitable for conversations where participants often pause.

```json
"participant_pause_sensitivity": "medium"
```

### 3. `participant_interrupt_sensitivity`

Controls how easily the participant can interrupt the replica while it is talking. This setting helps adjust how the replica handles overlap in conversation.

* **Options**:

  * `high`: The replica stops speaking immediately when the participant starts talking. Ideal for quick and back-and-forth exchanges.
  * `medium` **(default)**: Balanced behavior. Allows short interruptions without breaking the flow.
  * `low`: The participant needs to speak more clearly or for a bit longer to interrupt.
  * `verylow`: The replica usually keeps talking unless the interruption is strong.
  * `superlow`: The replica rarely stops mid-sentence. It will usually finish speaking before responding.

```json
"participant_interrupt_sensitivity": "medium"
```

### 4. `hotwords`

Use this to prioritize certain names or terms that are difficult to transcribe.
<Note>
This field is only available for `tavus-advanced` engine.
</Note>

```json
"hotwords": "Roey is the name of the person you're speaking with."
```

<Tip>
Use hotwords for proper nouns, brand names, or domain-specific language that standard STT engines might struggle with.
</Tip>

### 5. `smart_turn_detection`
Enables dynamic turn-taking using the Sparrow model, which dynamically adjusts the timeout based on what the users say. It sets a longer timeout when the user is likely not done speaking, and a shorter timeout when the user is likely done speaking.
```json
"smart_turn_detection": true
```
When used with `participant_pause_sensitivity`, that setting defines the maximum pause allowed before responding. For example:

- With `verylow`, the system allows longer pauses.

- However, when `smart_turn_detection` enabled the system will respond early if it confidently detects that the user has finished speaking, regardless of the maximum pause setting.
<Warning>
- `smart_turn_detection` is only supported by the `tavus-advanced` engine.
- Disabling `smart_turn_detection` turns off **Sparrow** and uses a fixed response delay based on `participant_pause_sensitivity`.
</Warning>
## Example Use Case

Below is an example persona with a fully configured STT layer:

```json
{
  "persona_name": "Customer Service Agent",
  "system_prompt": "You assist users by listening carefully and providing helpful answers.",
  "pipeline_mode": "full",
  "context": "You're handling voice-based customer support inquiries.",
  "default_replica_id": "rfe12d8b9597",
  "layers": {
    "stt": {
      "stt_engine": "tavus-advanced",
      "participant_pause_sensitivity": "medium",
      "participant_interrupt_sensitivity": "low",
      "hotwords": "support",
      "smart_turn_detection": true
    }
  }
}
```
