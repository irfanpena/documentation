description: Learn how to configure the STT layer when creating a persona in Tavus.
---

The STT Layer in Tavus empowers your persona to transcribe and comprehend spoken input in real time. By default, the STT layer in Tavus leverages `smart_turn_detection`, powered by **Sparrow-0**, for dynamic and responsive conversation flow with intelligent turn-taking.

## Configuring the STT Layer

Define the STT layer under the `layers.stt` object. Below are the parameters available:

### 1. `stt_engine`

Specifies the speech-to-text engine used for transcription.

- **Options**: `tavus-turbo`, `tavus-advanced`
<Note>
Non-English languages automatically use `tavus-advanced`.
</Note>
```json
"layers": {
  "stt": {
    "stt_engine": "tavus-advanced"
  }
}
````

<Note>
`tavus-turbo` offers faster response times, while `tavus-advanced` provides more accurate transcription quality.  
</Note>

### 2. `participant_pause_sensitivity`

Controls how long a pause is allowed before the digital replica responds.

* **Options**: `high`, `medium` (default), `low`, `verylow`, `superlow`

```json
"participant_pause_sensitivity": "medium"
```

### 3. `participant_interrupt_sensitivity`

Controls how easily the participant can interrupt the digital replica.

* **Options**: `high`, `medium` (default), `low`, `verylow`, `superlow`

```json
"participant_interrupt_sensitivity": "medium"
```

### 4. `hotwords`

Use this to prioritize certain names or terms that are difficult to transcribe.
<Note>
This field is only available for `tavus-advanced` engine.
</Note>

```json
"hotwords": "Roey is the name of the person you're speaking with."
```

<Tip>
Use hotwords for proper nouns, brand names, or domain-specific language that standard STT engines might struggle with.
</Tip>

### 5. `smart_turn_detection`
Enables dynamic turn-taking using the Sparrow-0 model, which dynamically adjusts the timeout based on what the users say. It sets a longer timeout when the user is likely not done speaking, and a shorter timeout when the user is likely done speaking.
```json
"smart_turn_detection": true
```
<Warning>
Disabling `smart_turn_detection` deactivates **Sparrow-0** and reverts to a fixed timeout method for turn transitions, which is less adaptive.
</Warning>
## Example Use Case

Below is an example persona with a fully configured STT layer:

```json
{
  "persona_name": "Customer Service Agent",
  "system_prompt": "You assist users by listening carefully and providing helpful answers.",
  "pipeline_mode": "full",
  "context": "You're handling voice-based customer support inquiries.",
  "default_replica_id": "rfe12d8b9597",
  "layers": {
    "stt": {
      "stt_engine": "tavus-advanced",
      "participant_pause_sensitivity": "medium",
      "participant_interrupt_sensitivity": "low",
      "hotwords": "support",
      "smart_turn_detection": true
    }
  }
}
```
