A Persona defines the behavior, voice, and response style of a Tavus Replica. It combines identity, contextual knowledge, and CVI pipeline configuration to create a real-time conversational agent.
## Persona Customization Options
Each persona includes configurable fields. Here's what you can customize:
- **Persona Name**: Display name shown when the replica joins a call.
- **System Prompt**: Instructions sent to the language model to shape the replica’s tone, personality, and behavior.
- **Context / Knowledge Base**: Background knowledge or reference information provided to the persona's language model.
- **Pipeline Mode**: Controls which CVI pipeline layers are active and how input/output flows through the system.
- **Default Replica**: Sets the visual avatar or character associated with the persona.
- **Layers**: Each layer in the pipeline processes a different part of the conversation. Layers can be configured individually to tailor input/output behavior to your application needs.

## CVI Layer
Tavus provides the following customizable layers as part of the CVI pipeline:
<CardGroup cols={2}>

  <Card title="Transport Layer" icon="video">
    Configures audio and video input/output, including microphone, camera, and replica streaming. Tavus uses <a href="https://www.daily.co/" target="_blank">Daily</a> as the default provider.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Perception Layer" icon="eye" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/perception">
    Defines how the persona interprets visual input like facial expressions and gestures.
  </Card>

  <Card title="STT Layer" icon="waveform" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/stt">
    Transcribes user speech into text using the configured speech-to-text engine.
  </Card>

  <Card title="LLM Layer" icon="brain" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/llm">
    Generates persona responses using a language model. Supports Tavus-hosted or custom LLMs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="TTS Layer" icon="microphone" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/tts">
    Converts text responses into speech using Tavus or supported third-party TTS engines.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Realtime Replica Layer" icon="robot" href="/sections/replica/overview">
    Streams lifelike avatar responses powered by Phoenix, Tavus’s real-time rendering model.
  </Card>

## Pipeline Mode
Tavus offers a number of modes that come with preconfigured layers as necessary for your use case:
### Full Pipeline Mode (Default & Recommended)
<Frame>
![](/images/full.gif)
</Frame>
The default and recommended end-to-end configuration optimized for real-time conversation. All CVI layers are active and customizable.

* Lowest latency
* Best for natural humanlike interactions

<Note> We offer a selection of optimized LLMs including **Llama 3.3 and OpenAI models** that are fully optimized for the full pipeline mode.</Note>

### Custom LLM / Bring Your Own Logic
<Frame>
![](/images/custom-llm.gif)
</Frame>
Use this mode to integrate a custom LLM or a specialized backend for interpreting transcripts and generating responses.

* Adds latency due to external processing
* Does **not** require an actual LLM—any endpoint that returns a compatible chat completion format can be used

### Echo Pipeline Mode
**Echo Mode** gives you full control over the Replica’s speech by letting you bypass Tavus’s core layers and supply your own input directly. There are two echo modes:
#### 1. **Text or Audio (Base64) Echo**
<Frame>
![](/images/echo-1.gif)
</Frame>
Microphone is disabled in the Transport layer.
* **Text Echo**

  * Bypasses **Perception**, **STT**, and **LLM**
  * Sends raw text directly to the **TTS Layer**
  * Useful for manually scripted speech and interrupt control

* **Audio (Base64) Echo**

  * Bypasses all layers except the **Realtime Replica Layer**
  * Sends base64-encoded audio for direct playback by the Replica

<Note>
Send text or base64 audio using the [**Interactions Protocol**](/sections/event-schemas/conversation-echo).
</Note>

#### 2. **Microphone Echo**
<Frame>
![](/images/echo-2.gif)
</Frame>
Microphone is enabled in the Transport layer.

* Bypasses all CVI layers (Perception, STT, LLM, TTS)
* Streams pre-generated audio directly into the Replica
* All interrupt logic must be embedded in your audio stream
