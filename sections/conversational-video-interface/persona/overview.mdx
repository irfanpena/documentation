Personas are the ‘character’ or ‘AI agent personality’ and contain all of the settings and configuration for that character or agent. For example, you can create a persona for ‘Tim the sales agent’ or ‘Rob the interviewer’.

Personas combine identity, contextual knowledge, and CVI pipeline configuration to create a real-time conversational agent with a distinct behavior, voice, and response style..

## Persona Customization Options

Each persona includes configurable fields. Here's what you can customize:

- **Persona Name**: Display name shown when the replica joins a call.
- **System Prompt**: Instructions sent to the language model to shape the replica’s tone, personality, and behavior.
- **Conversational Context**: Background knowledge or reference information provided to the persona's language model.
- **Pipeline Mode**: Controls which CVI pipeline layers are active and how input/output flows through the system.
- **Default Replica**: Sets the digital human associated with the persona.
- **Layers**: Each layer in the pipeline processes a different part of the conversation. Layers can be configured individually to tailor input/output behavior to your application needs.

## Layer

Explore our in-depth guides to customize each layer to fit your specific use case:

  <Card title="Perception Layer" icon="eye" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/perception">
    Defines how the persona interprets visual input like facial expressions and gestures.

  <Card title="STT Layer" icon="waveform" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/stt">
    Transcribes user speech into text using the configured speech-to-text engine.

  <Card title="LLM Layer" icon="brain" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/llm">
    Generates persona responses using a language model. Supports Tavus-hosted or custom LLMs.

## Pipeline Mode

Tavus provides several pipeline modes, each with preconfigured layers tailored to specific use cases:

### Full Pipeline Mode (Default & Recommended)

</Frame>

The default and recommended end-to-end configuration optimized for real-time conversation. All CVI layers are active and customizable.

- Lowest latency
- Best for natural humanlike interactions

<Note>
   We offer a selection of optimized LLMs including **Llama 3.3 and OpenAI models** that are fully optimized for the full pipeline mode.

### Custom LLM / Bring Your Own Logic

<Frame>
  ![](/images/custom-llm.png)
</Frame>

Use this mode to integrate a custom LLM or a specialized backend for interpreting transcripts and generating responses.

- Adds latency due to external processing
- Does **not** require an actual LLM—any endpoint that returns a compatible chat completion format can be used
