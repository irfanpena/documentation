A **persona** defines how a Tavus replica behaves, speaks, and responds. It bundles identity, knowledge, and CVI pipeline settings to create a real-time conversational agent.


## Persona Customization Options

Each persona includes configurable fields. Here's what you can customize:

### Persona Name

Display name shown when the replica joins a call.

<Tip>
**Best Practices**

Use a clear, human-readable name
</Tip>

### System Prompt
Instructions sent to the language model to shape the replica’s tone, personality, and behavior.

<Tip>
**Best Practices**
- Define a role (e.g., “You are a cheerful tour guide.”).
- Set boundaries (e.g., “Be concise and supportive.”).
- Avoid overloading with content or factual data.
</Tip>
### Context / Knowledge Base
Background knowledge or reference information provided to the persona's language model .

<Tip>
**Best Practices**
- Add product FAQs, background details, or structured information.
- Avoid duplicating the system prompt.
- Don’t include personal user data.
</Tip>
### Pipeline Mode
Controls which CVI pipeline layers are active and how input/output flows through the system.

Options:

- `full` (default): All layers are enabled for end-to-end multimodal processing.

- `echo`: Sends raw audio or text directly to the TTS layer.

<Note> We recommend using the `full` pipeline.</Note>
### Default Replica
Sets the visual avatar or character associated with the persona.

<Note>
You can also change a persona's default replica when creating a conversation.
</Note>

### Layers

Each layer in the pipeline processes a different part of the conversation. Layers can be configured individually to tailor input/output behavior to your application needs.

* **Transport Layer**
  <br/>Configures audio and video input/output settings, including microphone, camera, and replica streaming. Tavus uses [Daily](https://www.daily.co/) as the default provider for this layer.

* [**Perception Layer**](/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/perception)
  <br/>Configures how the persona processes visual input using.

* [**STT Layer**](/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/stt)
  <br/>Configures the speech-to-text engine used to transcribe user speech into text.

* [**LLM Layer**](/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/llm)
  <br/>Configures the language model that generates the persona’s responses, including support for custom LLMs.

* [**TTS Layer**](/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/tts)
  <br/>Configures how text responses are converted into speech using Tavus or supported third-party tts engines.

* **Realtime Replica Layer**
  <br/>Streams visually expressive avatar responses using **Phoenix**, Tavus's replica rendering model.
