## Using Daily JS SDK

The [Daily JS SDK](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/prebuilt/customizing-daily-prebuilt) offers **full UI control and advanced features**, making it ideal for building a fully customized Tavus CVI experience. You can try implementing the Daily JS SDK by following the steps in our <a href="/sections/integrations/embedding-cvi#daily-js-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Embed CVI Guide</a>.

## Enabling Noise Cancellation

Daily provides built-in noise cancellation, which can be easily enabled using the `updateInputSettings()` method to **enhance audio clarity** during calls, resulting in a more engaging interaction. 

```js
callFrame.updateInputSettings({
  audio: {
    processor: {
      type: 'noise-cancellation',
    },
  },
});
```

## Adding hair check screen

<Tip>
A **hair check screen** is a pre-conversation interface, often resembling a waiting room, that provides users with a transition between initiating a conversation and the actual beginning of the conversation.
</Tip>

The hair check screen allow users to **verify their audio and video settings** before joining a live session, ensuring everything is configured properly. It also helps **mask the brief latency period** before the conversation starts, creating a smoother transition into the interaction.
