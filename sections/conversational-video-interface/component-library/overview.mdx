## Overview

The Tavus Conversational Video Interface (CVI) React component library provides a complete set of pre-built components and hooks for integrating AI-powered video conversations into your React applications. This library simplifies setting up Tavus in your codebase, allowing you to focus on your application's core features.

Key features include:

- **Pre-built video chat components**
- **Device management** (camera, microphone, screen sharing)
- **Real-time audio/video processing**
- **Customizable styling** and theming
- **TypeScript support** with full type definitions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have a React project set up.

Alternatively, you can start from our example project: [CVI UI Haircheck Conversation Example](https://github.com/Tavus-Engineering/tavus-examples/tree/main/examples/cvi-ui-haircheck-conversation) - this example already has the HairCheck and Conversation blocks set up.

### 1. Initialize CVI in Your Project

```bash
npx @tavus/cvi-ui@latest init
```

- Creates a `cvi-components.json` config file
- Prompts for TypeScript preference
- Installs npm dependencies (@daily-co/daily-react, @daily-co/daily-js, jotai)

### 2. Add CVI Components

```bash
npx @tavus/cvi-ui@latest add conversation
```

### 3. Wrap Your App with the CVI Provider

```tsx
import { CVIProvider } from './components/cvi/components/cvi-provider';

function App() {
  return <CVIProvider>{/* Your app content */}</CVIProvider>;
}
```

### 4. Add a Conversation Component

Learn how to create a conversation URL at [https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation](https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation)

```tsx
import { Conversation } from './components/cvi/components/conversation';

function CVI() {
  const handleLeave = () => {
    // handle leave
  };
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        maxWidth: '1200px',
        margin: '0 auto',
      }}
    >
      <Conversation
        conversationUrl='YOUR_TAVUS_MEETING_URL'
        onLeave={handleLeave}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
