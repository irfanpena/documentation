Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is a framework for creating real-time multimodal video interactions with AI. It enables AI agents to see, hear, and respond naturally, mirroring human conversation.

## Key Concepts
CVI is built around three core concepts that work together to create real-time, humanlike interactions with AI agents:

  <Card title="Persona" icon="heart-pulse" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/overview">
    The **Persona** defines the AI agentâ€™s behavior, tone, and knowledge. It controls how the agent understands input, forms responses, and speaks. The persona also configures the underlying CVI pipeline.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Replica" icon="users" href="/sections/replica/overview">
    The **Replica** brings the persona to life visually. It renders a photorealistic human-like avatar using the **Phoenix-3** model, complete with facial expressions and synchronized lip movements.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Conversation" icon="video" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation/overview">
    A **Conversation** is a real-time video call session between the user and the AI agent. It connects the configured persona and replica through a managed WebRTC connection, enabling live, two-way interaction.

## Layers

The **Conversational Video Interface (CVI)** is built on a modular layer system. Each layer can be configured through the [**Persona settings**](/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/overview#cvi-layer) to match your specific use case.

These layers allow you to:

* Use your own LLM or select Tavus-optimized models with built-in function calling.
* Customize  text-to-speech (TTS) engines for full control over voice output.
* Customize speech-to-text (STT) to use smart turn-taking behavior, including interruption handling and pause sensitivity.
* Access raw video and audio streams to build a fully custom frontend experience.





## Getting Started
You can quickly create a conversation by using the [Tavus Platform](https://platform.tavus.io/) or following the steps in the [Quickstart](/sections/conversational-video-interface/full-mode) guide.
