Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is a framework for creating real-time video interactions with AI. It enables AI agents to see, hear, and respond naturally, mirroring human conversation.

CVI consists of three core components:
- **Persona**: Defines the AI agent’s behavior, tone, knowledge, and capabilities. Shaping how it responds during a conversation.
- **Replica**: Renders the AI agent’s visual appearance, with facial animations synced to speech for a lifelike presence using the Phoenix-3 model.
- **Conversation**: A real-time video call session where users interact with the AI agent powered by the configured persona and replica.


## Key Features

- **API-First Design**: Quickly build and test AI video conversations using our easy-to-integrate API.
- **Modular Pipeline**: Works with your existing LLMs, RAG, and TTS, giving you full control over identity, responses, and knowledge.
- **Easy Deployment and Scaling**: Run AI conversations at any scale. No need to worry about GPUs, traffic limits, or complex backend setup.
- **World’s Lowest Latency**: Achieve ~600ms utterance-to-utterance latency response time for fast, natural conversations with accurate turn-taking.
- **Multilingual Support**: CVI supports over 30 languages.
- **Lifelike AI Replicas**: Choose from 100+ lifelike stock replicas or create custom digital twins that look and sound human.


## Layers

The CVI is built on a modular layer system. Each layer can be customized through the [Persona configuration](/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/overview) to match your specific requirements:

* **Transport (WebRTC)**
* **Perception**
* **STT (Speech-to-Text)**
* **LLM (Language Model)**
* **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**
* **STS (Speech-to-Speech)**

With these configurable layers, you can:

* Integrate your own LLM or use Tavus-optimized models with function calling.
* Customize STT and TTS engines for full control over voice and transcription.
* Fine-tune turn-taking behavior, including interruption sensitivity and pause detection.
* Access video streams directly to build a fully custom user interface.




## Getting Started
You can quickly create a conversation by using the [Tavus Platform](https://platform.tavus.io/) or following the steps in the [Quickstart](/sections/conversational-video-interface/full-mode) guide.
