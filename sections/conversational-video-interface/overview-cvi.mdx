Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is a framework for creating real-time multimodal video interactions with AI. It enables an AI agent to see, hear, and respond naturally, mirroring human conversation.

CVI is the world’s fastest interface of its kind. It allows you to map a human face and conversational ability onto your AI agent. With CVI, you can achieve utterance-to-utterance latency with SLAs under 1 second. This is the full round-trip time for a participant to say something and the replica to reply.

CVI provides a comprehensive solution, with the option to plug in your existing components as required.

## Key Concepts

CVI is built around three core concepts that work together to create real-time, humanlike interactions with an AI agent:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Persona" icon="heart-pulse" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/overview">
    The **Persona** defines the agent’s behavior, tone, and knowledge. It also configures the CVI layer and pipeline.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Replica" icon="user-group" href="/sections/replica/overview">
    The **Replica** brings the persona to life visually. It renders a photorealistic human-like avatar using the **Phoenix-3** model.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conversation" icon="video" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation/overview">
    A **Conversation** is a real-time video session that connects the persona and replica through a WebRTC connection.

## Layers

The Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is built on a modular layer system, where each layer handles a specific part of the interaction. Together, they capture input, process it, and generate a real-time, human-like response.

Here’s how the layers work together:
<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="1. Transport" icon="right-left">
    Handles real-time audio and video streaming using WebRTC (powered by Daily). This layer captures the user's microphone and camera input and delivers output back to the user.  

    This layer is always enabled. You can configure input/output for audio (mic) and video (camera).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Perception" icon="eye">
    Uses **Raven** to analyze user expressions, gaze, background, and screen content. This visual context helps the replica understand and respond more naturally.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Speech Recognition (STT)" icon="ear-listen">
    Powered by **Sparrow**, this layer transcribes user speech in real time with lexical and semantic awareness. It enables smart, natural turn-taking through fast, intelligent interruptions.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Large Language Model (LLM)" icon="brain">
    Processes the user's transcribed speech and visual input using a low-latency LLM. Tavus provides ultra-low latency optimized LLMs or lets you integrate your own.
    
    <a href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/llm" target="_blank">Click here to learn how to configure the Large Language Model (LLM) layer.</a>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Text-to-Speech (TTS)" icon="volume-high">
    Converts the LLM response into speech using the supported TTS Engines (Cartesia **(Default)**, ElevenLabs, PlayHT).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Realtime Replica" icon="face-smile">
    Delivers a high-quality, synchronized digital human response using Tavus's real-time avatar engine powered by **Phoenix**.
