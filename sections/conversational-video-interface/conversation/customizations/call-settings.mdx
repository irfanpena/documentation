<Step title="Step 2: Make your First Conversation" titleSize="h3">
<Note>
In this example, we will use stock replica ID ***rfe12d8b9597*** (Nathan) and stock persona ID ***pdced222244b*** (Sales Coach).
</Note>

Use the following request body example:
```shell cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://tavusapi.com/v2/conversations \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
  --data '{
  "persona_id": "pdced222244b",
  "replica_id": "rfe12d8b9597",
  "callback_url": "https://yourwebsite.com/webhook",
  "conversation_name": "Improve Sales Technique",
  "conversational_context": "I want to improve my sales techniques. Help me practice handling common objections from clients and closing deals more effectively.",
  "properties": {
    "max_call_duration": 1800,
    "participant_left_timeout": 60,
    "participant_absent_timeout": 120
   }
}'

```
The request example above includes the following customizations:
| Parameter | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| `max_call_durations` | Sets the maximum call length in seconds. Maximum: 3600 seconds. |
| `participant_left_timeout` | Time (in seconds) to wait before ending the call after the last participant leaves. Default: 0\. |
| `participant_absent_timeout` | Time (in seconds) to end the call if no one joins after it's created. Default: 300\. |

</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Join the Conversation" titleSize="h3">
To join the conversation, click the link in the ***conversation_url*** field from the response:

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "ca4301628cb9",
  "conversation_name": "Improve Sales Technique",
  "conversation_url": "<conversation_link>",
  "status": "active",
  "callback_url": "https://yourwebsite.com/webhook",
  "created_at": "2025-05-13T06:42:58.291561Z"
}
```
Based on the call time settings above:
- The conversation will automatically end after 1800 seconds (30 minutes), regardless of activity.
- If the participant leaves the conversation, it will end 60 seconds after they disconnect.
- If the participant is present but inactive (e.g., not speaking or engaging), the conversation ends after 120 seconds of inactivity.
