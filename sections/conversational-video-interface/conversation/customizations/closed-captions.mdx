To enable subtitle, set the `enable_closed_captions` parameter to `true` when creating the conversation:

  "replica_id": "rfe12d8b9597",
  "callback_url": "https://yourwebsite.com/webhook",
  "conversation_name": "Improve Sales Technique",
  "conversational_context": "I want to improve my sales techniques. Help me practice handling common objections from clients and closing deals more effectively.",
  "properties": {
    "enable_closed_captions": true
   }
}'
