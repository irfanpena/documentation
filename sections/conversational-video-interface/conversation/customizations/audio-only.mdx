In this example, we will use stock persona ID ***pdced222244b*** (Sales Coach).
</Note>

To enable audio-only mode, set the `audio_only` parameter to `true` when creating the conversation:
```shell cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://tavusapi.com/v2/conversations \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
  --data '{
  "persona_id": "pdced222244b",
  "audio_only" true
}'

```

To join the conversation, click the link in the ***conversation_url*** field from the response:

```json
