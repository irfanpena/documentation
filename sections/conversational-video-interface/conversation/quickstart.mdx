## Create an Audio-Only Conversation
You can configure a conversation to run in audio-only mode, meaning no video will be streamed during the interaction. This mode is ideal for use cases like phone calls, smart speakers, or any environment where video is unnecessary or unsupported.

To enable audio-only mode, set the `audio_only` parameter to `true` when creating the conversation:
```shell cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://tavusapi.com/v2/conversations \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <your_api_key>' \
  --data '{
  "persona_id": "pdced222244b",
  "audio_only" true
}'

```
<Note>
All features in the persona's pipeline, including advanced turn taking, perception, and language understanding, remain fully active in audio-only mode. The only change is that video rendering is not included.
