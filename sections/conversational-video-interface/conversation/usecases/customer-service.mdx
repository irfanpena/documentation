This predefined persona is configured to provide personalized history lessons. It includes:

- **Persona Identity**: A professional customer service agent that helps users with real product or service issues. The agent speaks clearly and responds with empathy, adjusting based on how the user sounds or looks.
* **Full Pipeline Mode**: Enables the full Tavus conversational pipeline, including Perception, STT, LLM, and TTS.
- **System Prompt**: Tells the agent to act professionally and respond helpfully, while being aware of the user’s emotional state.
- **Context**: Describes a real customer support situation. The agent listens to the user’s issue, helps resolve it, and changes its tone or pace if the user seems frustrated or confused.
- **Persona Layer**:
  - **LLM Layer**: Uses the `resolve_customer_issue` tool to gather:
    * `product`: what the issue is about
    * `issue_description`: a short explanation of the problem
    * `urgency`: how serious the issue is (`low`, `medium`, or `high`)
  - **Perception Layer**: Uses the `raven-0` model to watch for signs like fidgeting, slouching, or facial expressions. If the user appears upset, it calls the `user_emotional_state` tool with:
    * `emotional_state`: what the user seems to feel (e.g., frustrated, calm)
    * `indicator`: what was observed (e.g., sighing, avoiding eye contact)
  - **TTS Layer**: Employs the `cartesia` voice engine with emotion control.
  - **STT Layer**: Uses `tavus-advanced` engine with smart turn detection for seamless real-time conversations.
