title: Roll a Dice
description: Create an interactive dice game with a Tavus-powered AI game master using CVI and tool calls.
---

This example demonstrates how to build a simple dice game where a replica plays the role of a game master. The game master listens to user input, responds conversationally, and performs `roll-dice` tool through Tavus CVI (Conversational Video Interface).

This persona simulates a friendly Game Master that guides players through gameplay and handles dice rolls using tool calls.

* **Persona Identity**: Named **DND Game Master**, this persona simulates a helpful and engaging guide for users playing Dungeons and Dragons. It responds to player requests—such as rolling dice—and manages the experience through dynamic, spoken interactions.

* ***system\_prompt***: Instructs the AI to adopt the role of a Dungeon Master, guiding users through DND scenarios. It emphasizes a friendly and responsive tone, enabling a seamless roleplay experience.

* ***context***: Clarifies that the AI should listen for requests like “Roll a four-sided dice” and use the `roll_dice` tool accordingly. This ensures user intents are properly recognized and acted upon.

* **Model Layers**:
  * **LLM**: Defines a `roll_dice` tool with a single `side` parameter, limited to `"Four"` or `"Six"`. This ensures the AI only rolls valid dice and avoids unexpected behavior.
  * **TTS**: Uses `cartesia` with emotion control for expressive speech.
  * **STT**: Uses `tavus-advanced` with high pause/interrupt sensitivity and smart turn detection.
