A Conversation is a real-time video session between a user and a Tavus Replica. It enables two-way, face-to-face interaction using a fully managed WebRTC connection.

## Conversation Creation Flow
When you create a conversation using the <a href="/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation" target="_blank">endpoint</a> or <a href="https://platform.tavus.io/" target="_blank">platform</a>:

1. A WebRTC room (powered by **Daily**) is automatically created.
2. You receive a meeting URL (e.g., `https://tavus.daily.co/ca980e2e`).
3. The **replica** joins and waits in the room, timers for duration and timeouts begin.
<Warning>
#### Billing Usage
Tavus charges usage based on your account plan. Credits begin counting when a conversation is created and the replica starts waiting in the room. Usage ends when the conversation finishes or times out. Each active session also uses one concurrency slot.
</Warning>

You can use the provided URL to enter the video room immediately. Alternatively, you can build a custom UI or stream handler instead of using the default interface.

### What is Daily?

Tavus integrates **Daily** as its WebRTC provider. You don't need to sign up for or manage a separate Daily account—Tavus handles the setup and configuration for you.

This lets you:

* Use the default video interface or <a href="/sections/integrations/embedding-cvi" target="_blank">customize the Daily UI</a>
* <a href="/sections/integrations/embedding-cvi" target="_blank">Embed the CVI in your app</a>


## Conversation Customizations
Tavus provides several customizations that you can set per conversation:
### Identity and Context Setup
- **Persona**: You can use a stock persona provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If no replica is specified, the default replica linked to the persona will be used (if available).
- **Replica**: Use a stock replica provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If a replica is provided without a persona, the default Tavus persona will be used.
- **Conversation Context**: Customize the conversation context to set the scene, explain the user’s role, say who joins the call, or point out key topics. It builds on the base persona and helps the AI give better, more focused answers.
- **Custom Greeting**: You can personalize the opening line that the AI should use when the conversation starts.
