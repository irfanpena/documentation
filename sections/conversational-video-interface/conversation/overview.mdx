A Conversation is a real-time video session between a user and a Tavus Replica. It enables two-way, face-to-face interaction using a fully managed WebRTC connection.

Tavus relies on [Daily](https://www.daily.co/) to manage the WebRTC infrastructure. You do not need to set up or maintain any of these components manually.

## Conversation Customizations
Tavus provides several customizations that you can set per conversation:
### Identity and Context Setup
- **Persona**: You can use a stock persona provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If no replica is specified, the default replica linked to the persona will be used (if available).
- **Replica**: Use a stock replica provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If a replica is provided without a persona, the default Tavus persona will be used.
- **Conversation Context**: Customize the conversation context to set the scene, explain the userâ€™s role, say who joins the call, or point out key topics. It builds on the base persona and helps the AI give better, more focused answers.
- **Custom Greeting**: You can personalize the opening line that the AI should use when the conversation starts.
### Advanced Customizations
- **Audio-Only Conversation**: Disable the video stream to create audio-only sessions. This is useful for phone calls, smart speaker interactions, or any scenario where video is unnecessary or unavailable.
- **Call Time Settings**: Define call duration and timeout limits to manage usage, control costs, and enforce concurrency limits.
- **Language**: Set the language used during the conversation.. Please see [Language Support](/sections/conversational-video-interface/language-support#supported-language) for more details.
- **Background Customization**: Use a green screen background or apply a custom one with WebGL for a more tailored visual experience.
- **Closed Captions**: Enable subtitles for accessibility or live transcription.
- **Call Recording**: Record conversations and store them in your own S3 bucket.
<Note> See [Customizations](/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation/customizations/call-settings) for a quickstart guide to each available customization. </Note>

## Credit Usage
Credit usage begins when the conversation is created and the replica starts waiting in the room. Billing continues until the conversation ends or times out. This also uses up one of your concurrency spots.
