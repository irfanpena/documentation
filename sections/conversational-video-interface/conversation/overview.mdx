A Conversation is a real-time video session between a user and a Tavus Replica. It enables two-way, face-to-face interaction using a fully managed WebRTC connection.

Tavus relies on [Daily](https://www.daily.co/) to manage the WebRTC infrastructure.
<Note>
### What is Daily?
Tavus uses Daily as the integrated WebRTC provider, so you don’t need to create a separate Daily account. The integration is handled for you, allowing you to build fully custom CVI applications without managing WebRTC yourself.
</Note>

## Conversation Customizations
Tavus provides several customizations that you can set per conversation:
### Identity and Context Setup
- **Persona**: You can use a stock persona provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If no replica is specified, the default replica linked to the persona will be used (if available).
- **Replica**: Use a stock replica provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If a replica is provided without a persona, the default Tavus persona will be used.
- **Conversation Context**: Customize the conversation context to set the scene, explain the user’s role, say who joins the call, or point out key topics. It builds on the base persona and helps the AI give better, more focused answers.
- **Custom Greeting**: You can personalize the opening line that the AI should use when the conversation starts.

## Billing Usage
Tavus charges usage based on your account plan. Credits begin counting when a conversation is created and the replica starts waiting in the room. Usage ends when the conversation finishes or times out. Each active session also uses one concurrency slot.
