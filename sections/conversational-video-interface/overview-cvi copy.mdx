Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is a framework for creating real-time multimodal video interactions with AI. It enables AI agents to see, hear, and respond naturally, mirroring human conversation.

## Key Concepts
CVI is built around three core concepts that work together to create real-time, humanlike interactions with AI agents:

  <Card title="Persona" icon="heart-pulse" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/overview">
    The **Persona** defines the agent’s behavior, tone, and knowledge. It also configures the CVI layer and pipeline.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Replica" icon="user-group" href="/sections/replica/overview">
    The **Replica** brings the persona to life visually. It renders a photorealistic human-like avatar using the **Phoenix-3** model.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Conversation" icon="video" href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation/overview">
    A **Conversation** is a real-time video session that connects the persona and replica through a WebRTC connection.

## Key Features

<Card title="Natural Interaction" icon="face-smile-beam">
CVI uses facial cues, body language, and real-time turn-taking to enable natural, human-like conversations.
</Card>

<Card title="Modular pipeline" icon="layer-group">
Customize the Perception, STT, LLM and TTS layers to control identity, behavior, and responses.
</Card>

<Card title="Lifelike AI replicas" icon="user-robot">
Choose from 100+ realistic avatars or create custom digital twins with human-like voice and expression.
</Card>

<Card title="Multilingual support" icon="globe">
Hold natural conversations in 30+ languages using the supported TTS engines.

## Layers

The **Conversational Video Interface (CVI)** is built on a modular layer system. Each layer can be configured through the <a href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/persona/overview#cvi-layer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Persona settings</strong></a> to match your specific use case.

These layers allow you to:

* Use your own LLM or select Tavus-optimized models with built-in function calling.
* Customize  text-to-speech (TTS) engines for full control over voice output.
* Customize speech-to-text (STT) to use smart turn-taking behavior, including interruption handling and pause sensitivity.
* Access raw video and audio streams to build a fully custom frontend experience.



## Getting Started
You can quickly create a conversation by using the <a href="https://platform.tavus.io/" target="_blank">Tavus Platform</a> or following the steps in the <a href="/sections/conversational-video-interface/full-mode" target="_blank">Quickstart</a> guide.
