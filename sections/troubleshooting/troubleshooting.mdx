    ## Overview

    When training the Phoenix model with Tavus, the size of your training video plays a crucial role in the processing time and success rate of your model training. To facilitate a smooth and efficient training process, adhering to the recommended video size guidelines is essential.

    ## Recommended Video Size

    The Tavus platform accepts training videos up to 750 MB in size. This limitation is based on our observations of optimal balance between video quality and processing efficiency.

    ## File Size Considerations

    - **Processing Efficiency**: Smaller file sizes typically result in faster upload times and more efficient processing, reducing the overall time required for model training.
    - **Success Rate**: Although Tavus will attempt to process larger files up to the 750 MB limit, we cannot guarantee successful processing for all large files. Staying within the recommended size increases the likelihood of a smooth training experience.
    - **Quality Preservation**: It's important to balance file size with video quality. Compressing your video to reduce its size should not significantly compromise its resolution, frame rate, or audio quality, as these factors are critical for training a high-quality Phoenix model.

    ## Tips for Reducing Video File Size

    1. **Compression**: Use video compression tools to reduce file size without substantially affecting quality.
    <Note>Currently, the **H.264 codec is required** by Tavus to ensure efficient compression.</Note>

    2. **Resolution Adjustment**: Consider reducing the video resolution if it's higher than necessary. For most training purposes, a resolution of 1080p (1920x1080) is sufficient.
    3. **Trimming**: Remove any unnecessary footage from the beginning and end of your training video to reduce its duration and size.
    4. **Frame Rate**: Lower the frame rate slightly if it's higher than 30 frames per second. Reducing the frame rate can decrease the file size without significantly impacting the video's appearance.

    ## Conclusion

    Adhering to the recommended training video size not only ensures efficient processing and higher success rates but also contributes to a smoother model training experience. By optimizing your video file size while maintaining quality, you can achieve the best outcomes from your Phoenix model training with Tavus.

  <Accordion title="Consent Statement">
    ## Introduction

    For the creation of any digital replicas using the Phoenix model, Tavus requires a clear, verbal consent statement to be included within the training video. This measure is crucial for ethical considerations and compliance with data protection regulations. Instances where this consent statement is missing can lead to processing delays or the inability to create your AI clone.

    ## Mandatory Consent Statement

    Every training video submitted for Phoenix model training must include the following consent statement, spoken by the individual being replicated:

    > "I, [FULL NAME], am currently speaking and give consent to Tavus to create an AI clone of me by using the audio and video samples I provide. I understand that this AI clone can be used to create videos that look and sound like me."

    ### Key Points:

    - **Personalization**: Replace "[FULL NAME]" with your actual full name.
    - **Clarity**: The statement must be clearly audible and understandable.
    - **Placement**: This consent should be at the beginning of your training video to ensure correct processing.
    - **Language**: We currently accept consent statements in **any** of our supported languages. You can see the [supported languages here](/sections/replicas/language-support#languages-we-support).

    ## Troubleshooting Missing Consent

    If you have submitted a training video without the requisite consent statement, it will not be processed, and your request to create a digital replica will be delayed. To resolve this issue:

    1. **Re-Record Your Video**: Include the consent statement at the beginning of your new training video.
    2. **Submit a New Request**: Upload the revised video and submit a new model training request through the Tavus Developer Portal or via API, as applicable.

    ## Tips for Successful Consent Recording

    - **Environment**: Record in a quiet setting to ensure the consent statement is clearly heard.
    - **Articulation**: Speak slowly and clearly, articulating each word to prevent any misunderstandings.
    - **Verification**: Review your video before submission to verify that the consent statement is correctly included and easily audible.

    ## Conclusion

    Including a consent statement in your training video is a critical step in the Phoenix model training process with Tavus. It not only ensures compliance with ethical standards and legal requirements but also facilitates a smoother and faster processing of your digital replica creation request. Ensure you follow the guidelines provided to avoid any unnecessary delays in your project.

  <Accordion title="Script Length">
    ## Overview

    While Tavus provides the flexibility to generate videos of various lengths, it's important to understand how the duration of a video can impact its overall quality and viewer perception. Videos exceeding approximately 5 minutes may encounter challenges related to gesture repetition and diminished naturalness in the replica's presentation.

    ## Understanding Video Length Considerations

    ### Quality Variation Beyond 5 Minutes

    Videos longer than 5 minutes are more likely to exhibit:

    - **Repeated Gestures**: Increased instances where the replica might repeat motions, making the video feel less dynamic.
    - **Decreased Naturalness**: A tendency for the replica's movements to appear less natural or fluid over time due to the limitations in variability of generated gestures.

    ## Troubleshooting and Optimization Strategies

    ### Splitting Longer Content

    For content that naturally extends beyond the 5-minute mark, consider dividing it into shorter segments. This approach can:

    - **Enhance Engagement**: Shorter videos are often more engaging, keeping viewers' attention focused.
    - **Maintain Quality**: Reduces the likelihood of encountering issues with repeated gestures or unnatural movements.

    ### Script Refinement

    Refining your script can significantly impact the video's effectiveness and length:

    - **Conciseness**: Ensure your script is concise, delivering your message without unnecessary filler.
    - **Pacing**: Adjust the pacing of your script to fit within the optimal video length, focusing on key points.

    ### Using Multiple Replicas

    Incorporating different replicas into longer content pieces can introduce variety and maintain viewer interest:

    - **Variety**: Switch between replicas to present different sections of your content.
    - **Personalization**: Use specific replicas for targeted segments, enhancing relevance and engagement.

    ### Review and Iteration

    After generating your video, review it thoroughly:

    - **Identify Repetitions**: Look for and note any instances of repeated gestures or unnatural movements.
    - **Iteration**: Use insights from your review to refine the script or consider breaking the content into smaller pieces if necessary.

    ## Conclusion

    While Tavus empowers users to generate videos of any length, being mindful of the potential quality variations in longer videos is crucial. By employing strategies like content splitting, script refinement, and using multiple replicas, you can create high-quality, engaging videos that effectively convey your message. Always review your generated content and be prepared to iterate for the best results.

    # Conversations

    ### Overview
    If `callback_url` is provided in the [Create Conversation API Request](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation), callbacks will be sent to provide inside into the state of the conversation. Our callbacks range from system-related callbacks like replica joins and room shutdowns, to application-related callbacks like final transcription parsing and recording ready webhooks, with many more webhooks coming soon!


    ## Conversation Callback Types

    Our callbacks are split into two main categories:
    - System Callbacks
    > These callbacks are to provide insight into system-related events in a conversation. They are:
      - **system.replica_joined**: This is fired when the replica becomes ready for a conversation.
      - **system.shutdown**: This is fired when the room shuts down, for any of the following reasons:
          - `max_call_duration reached`
          - `participant_left_timeout reached`
          - `participant_absent_timeout reached`
          - `bot_could_not_join_meeting_it_was_probably_ended`
          - `daily_room_has_been_deleted`
          - `exception_encountered_during_conversation_startup`
          - `end_conversation_endpoint_hit`
          - `internal error occurred at step x`

    - Application Callbacks
    > These callbacks are to inform developers about logical events that take place. They are:
      - **application.transcription_ready**: This is fired after ending a conversation, where the chat history is saved and returned.
      - **application.recording_ready**: This is fired if you had enabled recording on, set up a [custom S3 bucket](/sections/conversational-video-interface/recording-rooms) for recording and started a recording inside the room at any point. This will point to the key at which your new recording lies, useful for serving recordings through a CDN.
      - **application.perception_analysis**: This is fired after ending a conversation, when the replica has finished summarizing the visual artifacts that were detected throughout the call. This is a feature that is only available when the persona has `raven-0` specified in the [Perception Layer](/sections/conversational-video-interface/raven).


    ## Conversation Callback Structure
    All Conversation callbacks will share a similar structure with differences occuring in the `properties` object.

    Here is the basic structure for all callbacks:

    ```
    {
      "properties": {
        "replica_id": "<replica_id>"
      },
      "conversation_id": "<conversation_id>",
      "webhook_url": "<webhook_url>",
      "event_type": "<event_type>",
      "message_type": "<system/application>",
      "timestamp": "<timestamp>"
    }
    ```
