openapi: post /v2/conversations
description: |
    This endpoint starts a real-time video conversation with your AI replica, powered by a persona that allows it to see, hear, and respond like a human.

        The response includes a `conversation_url` that you can use to join the call or embed it on your website. <a href="/sections/integrations/embedding-cvi" target="_blank">Learn how to embed it here</a>.
        
        If you provide a `callback_url`, youâ€™ll receive webhooks with updates about the conversation status. <a href="/sections/webhooks-and-callbacks" target="_blank">Learn more about Callback here</a>.

        <Warning>
        - **If your persona does not have a default replica**, the `replica_id` is required.
        - **If your persona has a default replica**, the `replica_id` is not required.
        - **If your persona has a default replica and you define `replica_id`**, it will override the persona's default replica.
        </Warning>
