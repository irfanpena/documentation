openapi: post /v2/conversations
description: |
    This endpoint starts a real-time video conversation with your AI replica, powered by a persona that allows it to see, hear, and respond like a human.


        **Core Components:**
        - Replica - Choice of audio/visual appearance 
        - Persona - Define the replica's behavior and capabilities

        
        The response includes a `conversation_url` that you can use to join the call or embed it on your website. <a href="/sections/integrations/embedding-cvi" target="_blank">Learn how to embed it here</a>.
        
        If you provide a `callback_url`, youâ€™ll receive webhooks with updates about the conversation status. <a href="/sections/webhooks-and-callbacks" target="_blank">Learn more about Callback here</a>.
        <Accordion title="Required Parameters" icon="lightbulb">
        Required parameters vary depending on the use case:

        **Full Pipeline Conversation:**
        - `persona_id`
        - `replica_id`

        **Audio-Only Conversation:**
        - `persona_id`
        - `replica_id`
        - `audio_only`

        <Warning>
        - `replica_id` is **required** if the persona does **not** have a default replica.  
        - `replica_id` is **optional** if the persona **does** have a default replica.  
        - If both a default replica and `replica_id` are provided, the supplied `replica_id` will **override** the default.
        </Warning>
