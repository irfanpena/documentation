openapi: get /v2/conversations/{conversation_id}

<Accordion title="Verbose Response Data" icon="lightbulb">
You can append `?verbose=true` to the URL to receive additional event data in the response, including:
- `shutdown_reason`: The reason why the conversation ended (e.g., "participant_left_timeout")
- `transcript`: A complete transcript of the conversation with role-based messages (via `application.transcription_ready`)
- `perception_analysis`: A detailed analysis of the user's appearance, behavior, emotional states, and screen activities
- `system.replica_joined`: When the replica joined the conversation
- `system.shutdown`: When and why the conversation ended
- `application.perception_analysis`: The final visual analysis of the user

This is particularly useful as an alternative to using the `callback_url` parameter on the [create conversation](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation) endpoint for retrieving detailed conversation data.
