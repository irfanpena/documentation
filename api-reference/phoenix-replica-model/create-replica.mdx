openapi: post /v2/replicas
description: |
  This endpoint creates a new replica using the latest `phoenix-3` model, which can be used in real-time conversations.

  <Note>
  By default, all new replicas are trained using the `phoenix-3` model.  
  To use the older `phoenix-2` model, set the `model_name` parameter to `phoenix-2`.
  </Note>
