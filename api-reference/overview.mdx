## Getting Started with Tavus APIs
Tavus APIs allow you to create real-time conversational video interfaces powered by AI replicas. These replicas are guided by customizable personas and can see, hear, and respond in a human-like way. You can access the API through standard HTTP requests, making it easy to integrate Conversational Video Interface (CVI) into any application or platform.
### Who Is This For?
This API is designed for developers who want to leverage an AI agent for real-time human-like interactions.
