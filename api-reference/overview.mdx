## Getting Started with Tavus APIs
Tavus APIs allow you to create a Conversational Video Interface (CVI), an end-to-end pipeline for building real-time video conversations with an AI replica. Each replica is integrated with a persona that enables it to see, hear, and respond like a human.

You can access the API through standard HTTP requests, making it easy to integrate Conversational Video Interface (CVI) into any application or platform.
### Who Is This For?
This API is for developers looking to add real-time, human-like AI interactions into their apps or services.

### What Can You Do?
Use the end-to-end Conversational Video Interface (CVI) pipeline to build human-like, real-time multimodal video conversations with these three core components:
