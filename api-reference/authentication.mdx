To use the Tavus API, you need an API key to authenticate your requests. This key verifies that requests are coming from your Tavus account.

## Get the API key
1. Go to the <a href="https://platform.tavus.io/" target="_blank">Tavus platform</a> and select **API Key** from the sidebar menu.
2. Click **Create New Key** to begin generating your API key.
3. Enter a name for the key and (optional) specify allowed IP addresses, then click **Create API Key**.
4. Copy your newly created API key and store it securely.

<Warning>
**Remember that your API key is a secret!**

Never expose it in client-side code such as browsers or apps. Always load your API key securely from environment variables or a server-side configuration.
</Warning>

## Make Your First Call
Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. To authenticate with Tavus's API endpoints, you must provide the API Key in the header, as shown below.
```curl Authentication Header
'x-api-key: <api-key>'
```
For example, you are using the POST - Create Conversation endpoint to create a real-time video call session with a Tavus replica that has been configured with a persona. In this scenario, you can send an API request adding your API Key (`<api_key>`) as shown below:
```shell cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://tavusapi.com/v2/conversations \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api_key>' \
  --data '{
  "persona_id": "pe13ed370726",
  "conversation_name": "Interview User"
}'
```
